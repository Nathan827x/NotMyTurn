"I DID THE DISHES LAST TIME!"

NotMyTurn helps with tracking chores and who's responsible. If you have roomates or are living with others, you can split the chores in a fair way!

Why use NotMyTurn:
* No more fighting on who's turn it is to do anything!
* Helps people stay honest with chores and allows people to stay on top of things.
* Split the work up evenly. If someone doesn't like a chore, put their name in another chore twice. Be creative :)
